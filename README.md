# Robot20C
FRC Team 4450 2020 Robot Control program.

## This is Mr. Corn's command based form of 2020 robot code (development).

This is the 2020 competition robot control program created by the Olympia Robotics Federation (FRC Team 4450).
Operates the robot "TBA" for FRC game "INFINITE RECHARGE".

## Instructions to setup development environment for VS Code
1) Follow the instructions [here](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/java) to setup the JDK, Visual Studio Code, the FRC plugins and tools. Do not install the C++ portion. You do not need the FRC Update Suite to compile code.
2) Clone this repository to local folder.
3) Open that folder in Visual Studio Code.
4) Build the project using the WPILib command from the WPILib commands list.

### If RobotLib gets an update:
1) download the RobotLib.json file from the RobotLib Github repo and drop it into the vendordeps folder inside the project folder. Build the project.
